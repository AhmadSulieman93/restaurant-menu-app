# 🚀 How to Start Your Project

## Current Situation:
Yes, you need to start the backend manually each time. This is normal for development!

---

## ✅ Easy Ways to Start Backend:

### Option 1: Double-Click Script (Easiest!)
1. **Double-click** `start-backend.bat` in the project root
2. A window will open and start the backend
3. Keep that window open while working

### Option 2: PowerShell Script
1. Right-click `start-backend.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Backend starts automatically

### Option 3: Command Line (What you're doing now)
```bash
cd C:\Projects\restaurant-menu-app\backend\RestaurantMenu.API
dotnet run
```

---

## 📋 Complete Startup Process:

### Step 1: Start Backend
- Double-click `start-backend.bat` OR
- Run the command in CMD/PowerShell

### Step 2: Start Frontend (in a NEW terminal)
```bash
cd C:\Projects\restaurant-menu-app
npm run dev
```

## 💡 Why Manual Start?

- **Backend (.NET)** = Separate process, needs its own terminal
- **Frontend (Next.js)** = Separate process, needs its own terminal
- This is **normal** for full-stack development!

## 🔄 Alternative: VS Code Tasks (Advanced)

If you use VS Code, you can create tasks to start both automatically. Let me know if you want this setup!

---

## ✅ Quick Reference:

**Backend:** Double-click `start-backend.bat`  
**Frontend:** `npm run dev` in project root

That's it! 🎉
